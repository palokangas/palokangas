- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m currently working as a Full-Stack Developer in radio broadcasting automation
- ğŸ‘€ I try everyday to get better with the current stack I'm using (RoR, React, REST, db's, Docker, Jenkins etc.)
- ğŸ“ˆ I am especially interested in data analysis, particularily NLP.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently dipping my toes into functional programming (elisp, clojure) and deeper into AWS topics.
- ğŸ¥¸ I worked in journalism, R&D, media policy research and journalism education for 20 years before jumping to IT.
- ğŸ‘Ÿ Fun fact: to defy genetics, I also run long distances (my marathon record is 3:53)
- ğŸ“« To reach me, send mail: firstname at lastname dot net
