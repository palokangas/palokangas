- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m currently working as a developer at [Kisko Labs](https://www.kiskolabs.com).
- ğŸ‘€ I try everyday to get better with the current stack I'm using. Main focus is on Ruby on Rails these days.
- ğŸ“ˆ As a hobby, I have been interested in data analysis, particularily NLP.
- ğŸŒ± Next I would like to wade deeper into functional programming (elisp, clojure).
- ğŸ¥¸ I worked in journalism, R&D, media policy research and journalism education for 20 years before jumping to IT.
- ğŸ‘Ÿ Fun fact: to defy genetics, I also run long distances (my marathon record is 3:53)
- ğŸ“« To reach me, send mail: firstname at lastname dot net
